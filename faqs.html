                <P>
                    There are two ways to type faster: The best way to increase typing speed is to learn to type the correct way. “Touch typing” means you are able to type with all 10 fingers instead of using a “hunt and peck” method of typing. The second way you can learn to type faster is by playing typing games. Keyboard games like TypeRivals can help you practice your typing speed and increase your words per minute score.

            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>There's no single "correct" typing speed, as it depends on your needs and goals. However, here are some general guidelines based on age and skill level:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Elementary School (Grades 3–5):</b> 8–15 WPM</li>
                    <li><b>Middle School (Grades 6–8):</b> 12–25 WPM</li>
                    <li><b>High School (Grades 9–12):</b> 20–35 WPM</li>
                    <li><b>College/Adult:</b> 50+ WPM (and often much higher for professionals)</li>
                    <li><b>Average Typing Speed for Adults:</b> The average typing speed for adults is around 40 WPM.</li>
                    <li><b>Good Typing Speed for Adults:</b> A typing speed of 60-70 WPM is generally considered good for most purposes.</li>
                    <li><b>Professional Typing Speed:</b> Professionals who type regularly often achieve speeds of 80+ WPM, with some exceeding 100 WPM.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ultimately, the goal is to type at a speed that allows you to comfortably and efficiently complete your tasks without sacrificing accuracy. Focus on improving your own speed gradually rather than comparing yourself to others.</p>

            <div class="faq-question">How is typing speed measured?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Typing speed is measured by the number of words you can type correctly in a set amount of time. A “word” is equivalent to five keystrokes. During a test, both speed and accuracy are measured. You will receive a number that indicates your average words per minute (WPM) and a percentage that indicates your accuracy.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Why is it important to take a typing speed test?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Taking a typing speed test establishes your average typing speed (WPM) and accuracy, which is an important baseline to know so you can increase speed and improve accuracy with practice. Periodically taking typing speed tests can help you track your progress and measure improvement. You even can use your WPM score from the typing test on your resume to highlight your administrative skills.</p>
